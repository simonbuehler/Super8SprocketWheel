## 🎥Parametric Normal 8 / Super 8 Film Sprocket Wheel🎬

This repository contains a [FreeCAD](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD) project for creating parametric sprocket wheels compatible with Normal 8 and Super 8 film formats. Simply input the desired number of teeth in the spreadsheet, and the model will generate a sprocket wheel with correct dimensions.

## 🛠️ Features

- 💡 Parametric model: Change the number of teeth in the spreadsheet and the model will adjust accordingly.
- 🎞️ Supports both Normal 8 and Super 8 film formats: The default model is for Normal 8, but parameters for Super 8 are commented in the spreadsheet.
- 📏 Accurate dimensions: Ensures smooth and precise film transport.
- 🔄 Seamless generation: Simply adjust parameters, generate your model, and export it for 3D printing or manufacturing.
- ⚙️ 3D Printer optimized: splitted the wheel into pluggable parts without overhangs and need for support structures.

## ⚙️ How to Use

1. Clone this repository or [download the FreeCAD file](sprocketwheel.FCStd).
2. Open the file in FreeCAD. If you don't have FreeCAD installed, you can download it [here](https://www.freecadweb.org/downloads.php).
3. Go to the spreadsheet workbench and adjust the number of teeth.
4. Switch back to the 3D view and see your generated sprocket wheel.
5. Export the model for 3D printing or CNC manufacturing.
